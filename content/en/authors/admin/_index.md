I'm a developer at [Oslandia](https://oslandia.com) and a PhD candidate in digital archaeology at [LAMPEA](https://lampea.cnrs.fr) (Aix Marseille University), focusing on the development of open source web interfaces for working with digital twins of archaeological sites. I am also the [creator](https://mapper.fr/blog/introducing-mapstodon/) of [Mapstodon.space](https://mapstodon.space), a multilingual Mastodon instance dedicated to cartography that gather more than 2000 people now. Finally, I sometimes carry out [occasional cartographic projects](https://mapper.fr/en/blog/2022-12/ips) and lately I've been very interested in [permacomputing](https://permacomputing.net/), [digital sobriety](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobri%C3%A9t%C3%A9_num%C3%A9rique) and the need to [rewild of the internet](https://www.noemamag.com/we-need-to-rewild-the-internet/).
