I'm a GIS engineer at [Oslandia](https://oslandia.com) and PhD candidate in digital archaeology at [LAMPEA](https://lampea.cnrs.fr) (Aix Marseille University), focusing on the development of open source web interfaces for working with digital twins of archaeological prehistoric sites. I run [Mapstodon.Space](https://mapper.fr/blog/introducing-mapstodon/) of [Mapstodon.space](https://mapstodon.space), a multilingual Mastodon instance dedicated to cartography. As a former geographer and cartographer, I still work on [cartographic projects](https://mapper.fr/en/blog/2022-12/ips) when I find room for it, and lately I've been interested in [permacomputing](https://permacomputing.net/), digital sobriety and the need to [rewild the internet](https://www.noemamag.com/we-need-to-rewild-the-internet/).
