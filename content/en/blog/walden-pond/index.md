    >  When it comes to unplugging and digital detoxes, some of the more loony self-help gurus preach an all-or-nothing doctrine that’s not that helpful if you live in the real* world. (*Whatever that actually means.)
    
    Henry Thoreau wrote Walden while shacked up in a cabin by Walden Pond (the lake). He was making a show of being far from the madding crowd, but was only 2 miles away from town, and would get his mum to do his laundry. This isn’t taking a swipe at Thoreau for being disingenuous, I think it was smart. He was managing his attention, not living in a state of nature, and not living in a state of perpetual hyperstimulation.
