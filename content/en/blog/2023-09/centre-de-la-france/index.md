This summer, the vacation route passed right through the middle of the country. It was too good an opportunity not to make a detour to the hamlet of La Coucière, in [Vesdun, Cher](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=14/46.5813/2.4429): in 1993, the IGN located the geographical center of continental France, also known as the Hexagon, i.e. [metropolitan France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_France) excluding Corsica.

This 1993 calculation is just the latest answer to a [very old question](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_de_la_France). It has the advantage of including the Earth's curvature in the calculation parameters for the first time.

So, early in the morning of July 31, 2023, we found ourselves in the [center of gravity](https://mapper.fr/carnet/centre-gravite-marseille-radio/) of the country [^1]. The weather was warm, the sun was already shining and a few cows were grazing peacefully in the sleepy calm of a summer's day.d

[^1]: Or [centroid](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/centroid), as GIS analysts would say.
