Yesterday, for the first time in many months, I took advantage of a particularly quiet Friday evening to play on the computer. Although I've never been an avid consumer of video games, I do enjoy indulging in them from time to time. As my current machine has a particularly low-performance graphics card, I've had to give up playing games that are too resource-hungry. For example, I've yet to finish _The Witcher 3_, which I started on another, more powerful laptop, and which took up a lot of hours during the lockdown[^daron].

In the meantime, this creative constraint pushes me to seek out singular games instead of diving headfirst into the latest blockbuster craze[^zelda]. The last one to keep me on my toes was [_Firewatch_](https://www.firewatchgame.com/), about two years ago. A game tailor-made for a cartographer, where you play as a fire lookout in Wyoming in 1989. Between the beauty of the design, the exploration of National Parks wide-open spaces and the intriguing, subtle storyline, the game is captivating and I invite you to have a look at it.

Last night I started playing [_Wilderplace_](https://wilderplace.place/), a sort of puzzle-solving game created by Mapbox alumnus Samal Bemel Benrud. Its peaceful, wonderful atmosphere owes much to its hand-drawn graphics and _indie synth_ soundtrack.

> In Wilderplace, you are a shaman tasked with bringing balance to the once-idyllic Divine Garden. Explore the maze-like environment, harness magical artifacts, and uncover mysteries as you wrangle restless spirits and evade dangerous intruders.

Unlike _The Witcher_ and its sometimes distressing approaches (gender relations, for example), _Firewatch_ or _Wilderplace_ cultivate suggestion, delicacy and poetry, while remaining highly engaging and entertaining. Shoutout to the developers of these independent games[^valve] for offering us playful worlds that are less binary and more surprising!

[^daron]: I didn't have any children at the time. At the current rate, I should be able to resume my game around 2042 or 2043, when version 54 of _The Witcher_ will be released in Metavision<sup>tm</sup>. I can't wait.

[^zelda]: It [happens](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Tears_of_the_Kingdom) that I [regret](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elden_Ring) a little this technical limitation.

[^valve]: Independent at the time of _Firewatch_'s creation, the Campo Santo studio has since been bought out by Valve, the studio behind _Half-Life_ and owner of _Steam_.
