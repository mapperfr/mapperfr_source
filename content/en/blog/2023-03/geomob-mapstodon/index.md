The hosts of the famous and prolific [Geomob podcast](https://thegeomob.com) were kind enough to invite me for a conversation about [mapstodon.space](https://mapstodon.space) (see [this post](https://mapper.fr/carnet/introducing-mapstodon/) for more info on the Mastodon server for mapmakers).

The exchange lasts about 30 minutes. It was very pleasant and you may be tempted to listen - apologies in advance for my hesitant English!
