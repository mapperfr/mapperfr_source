A few months ago, following a lawsuit launched by journalist [Alexandre LÃ©chenet](https://mastodon.social/@alphoenix), the administrative court of Paris forced the Ministry of National Education to open the data on the social position index (SPI) of schools and colleges in France.

[According to WikipÃ©dia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indice_de_position_sociale), "The Social Position Index is a quantitative measure of the social situation of students in relation to learning in French schools. The higher the index, the more the student lives in a family context favorable to learning. This index is constructed from the professions and socio-professional categories (PCS) of the students' legal representatives."

I geolocated the 39,000+ facilities to map them. The scale goes from yellow for a very high SPI to purple for a very low SPI. Combined with information on the status of the institutions (private schools and colleges are surrounded by a white halo), the spatialization of this index tells a certain social geography of the country.
